					What is the LSCE Initiative?
				</h3>
				<div class="message">
					The LSCE Initiative is a MENA regional endeavor that provides a shared vision and holistic definition of quality learning through life skills and citizenship education. The LSCE Initiative has two main components: (i) the development of a Conceptual and Programmatic Framework (CPF) on life skills and citizenship education that will serve as a guide to vision/strategy development and programming at country level, and (ii) the organization of technical support to countries on planning and implementation.

				<div class="content">
					<p>
					The LSCE Initiative seeks to provide diverse stakeholders in MENA with an evidence-based framework for action towards the achievement of three interconnected outcomes: first, the achievement of a knowledge society through improved education outcomes; second, the realization of economic development through improved employment and entrepreneurship; and third, the attainment of enhanced social cohesion through improved civic engagement.
					</p>
					<p>
					At the regional level, the Initiative brings together the active contribution of the Arab League Educational, Cultural and Scientific Organization (<label class="blue">ALESCO</label>), along with ministries of education and other national institutions responsible of education across <label class="blue">20 MENA countries</label> including: <label class="blue">Algeria, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, State of Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, UAE</label> and <label class="blue">Yemen</label>.
					</p>
					<p>
					The United Nations agencies partnering in the initiative include: the International Labour Organization (<label class="blue">ILO</label>), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (<label class="blue">UNESCO</label>), United Nations Population Fund (<label class="blue">UNFPA</label>), the United Nations Higher Commissioner for Refugees (<label class="blue">UNHCR</label>), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (<label class="blue">UNRWA</label>), United Nations Childrenâ€™s Fund (<label class="blue">UNICEF</label>) and the World Bank. The Arab Institute for Human Rights (<label class="blue">AIHR</label>) is involved as a key regional institution promoting citizenship education in MENA.

				<h3 class="common-title-1 blue">A clear holistic vision and working definition of life skills and citizenship education.</h3>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						A vision and definition are required to facilitate a common understanding of life skills and citizenship education, as well as being crucial for policy formulation and the development of effective programming. The CPF proposes a four dimensional model of learning which consolidates and broaden the lifelong learning paradigm developed by the Delors Report: the cognitive dimension including skills for learning; the instrumental dimension including skills for employability; the individual dimension including skills for empowerment; and the social dimension including skills for active citizenship. A set of twelve core skills for MENA are identified within this model; they are: communication, cooperation, critical thinking, creativity, decision-making, empathy, negotiation, self-management, respect for diversity, resilience, participation, and problem solving. These twelve core skills are interrelated and mutually reinforce each other in light of the four Delors dimensions of learning. The acquisition of core skills is instrumental in buttressing foundational skills such as literacy and numeracy as well technical skills including functional ICT skills.

				<h3 class="common-title-1 blue">Effective teaching and learning approaches.</h3>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						Effective teaching and learning approaches underpin the operationalization of the twelve core skills. Changing the attitudes and improving the classroom skills of teachers represent the most promising entry point in bringing about systemic change. Such approaches include child-centered methodologies, activity-based learning, positive discipline, psychosocial support, etc. The experience of successful education reforms indicate that equipping and supporting teachers to practice active learning methods can bring about significant change in learning outcomes.

				<h3 class="common-title-1 blue">A multiple pathways approach. </h3>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						This approach is essential for mainstreaming LSCE and recognizes that life skills need to be developed along different educational pathways, including formal and non-formal education, on the road to and in the workplace, social engagement, and child protection. It also acknowledges the different modalities through which LSCE can be delivered, such as traditional face-to-face instruction and more innovative blended learning. A multiple pathways approach maximizes participation and ensures equity and inclusiveness through the targeting of marginalized populations. Furthermore, a multiple pathways approach is needed to ensure coherence in interventions and messages within different environments where children and youth learn, and to make sure that what is learnt in the classroom is supported by what is experienced outside the school.

				<h3 class="common-title-1 blue">A systems approach. </h3>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						A systems approach is required to achieve critical mass; national impact cannot be realized through the implementation of unconnected small scale interventions at the margins of the education system. To ensure national coverage, quality of learning processes and outcomes, as well as financial sustainability, it is necessary to take a systemic approach to developing LSCE programs.  The presence of an enabling environment, political will, commitment and cooperation among partners, and a shared vision are the assumptions that underpin the theory of change for this Initiative.
