				The case for life skills and citizenship education in MENA
			</span>
			<div class="intro-text">
				<p>
					The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region faces unprecedented challenges in terms of learning, employment and social cohesion, aggravated by a context of political instability and conflicts. The general consensus is that education systems are broadly failing to deliver the outcomes needed to advance individual and social development. The increasing number of education opportunities in the region has yet to translate into economic growth.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The LSCE Initiative is meant to redefine the concept of life skills and citizenship education in MENA while providing a roadmap that is relevant to MENA contexts. It represents a collaborative endeavour towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal 4 - Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all - through an integrated and holistic approach to education: fostering successful individuals in the context of the workplace while fulfilling educationâ€™s social role to enhance personal development and social cohesion.
